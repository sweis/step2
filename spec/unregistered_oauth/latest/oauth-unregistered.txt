1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This extension to the OAuth protocol uses the same terminology for
   Service Providers and Consumers as defined in [OAuth].  The following
   term is herein defined:

   Consumer Key Registration  The out-of-band process by which Service
      Providers and Consumers exchange the cryptographic keys called
      'consumer secrets' used in the OAuth protocol.

3.  Overview

   This extension describes a mechanism for Service Providers to satisfy
   requests from OAuth consumers that have not registered a consumer
   secret, and proposes a strategy to mitigate the security concerns
   that accepting unregistered consumers introduces.

   The organization of this spec follows the layout of Section 6 of
   [OAuth], with the same section and subsection title headers.  Each
   heading indicates only the differences of additions to each step that
   this extension requires.

4.  Authenticating with OAuth

4.1.  Obtaining an Unauthorized Request Token

4.1.1.  Consumer Obtains a Request Token

   The Consumer follows the steps outlined in Section 6.1.1 of [OAuth],
   with the following restrictions:

   oauth_consumer_key  The value SHOULD be the empty string.

   oauth_signature_method  The value SHOULD be "HMAC-SHA1"

   oauth_signature  The value MUST be the one computed according to
      Section 9 (Signing Requests), where the consumer secret is taken
      to be the empty string.

4.1.2.  Service Provider Issues an Unauthorized Request Token

   Unchanged from the regular OAuth spec.

4.2.  Obtaining User Authorization

4.2.1.  Consumer Directs the User to the Service Provider

   This differs from Section 6.2.1 of [OAuth] in that both 'oauth_token'
   and 'oauth_callback' MUST be included by the Consumer as part of the
   browser-mediated request.

4.2.2.  Service Provider Authenticates the User and Obtains Consent

   The Service Provider MUST use the callback URL to infer the entity
   that the user should trust in the request, and the Service Provider
   SHOULD NOT prompt the user for authorization if the callback URL is
   missing or is not a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL schema.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the Service Provider either perform verification of
   the callback URL (the precise mechanism for doing so is left
   unspecified here, but some suggestions are provided in the security
   considerations section).  If callback URL verification is not
   possible, it is RECOMMENDED that the Service Provider indicate to the
   user that there is a lower level of assurance about the identity of
   the party requesting authorization, differentiating these requests
   from those initiated by registered consumers.

   Apart from these considerations, the Service Provider should proceed
   as in Section 6.2.2 of [OAuth].

4.2.3.  Service Provider Directs the User Back to the Consumer

   In addition to 'oauth_token', the service provider MUST include an
   'oauth_cb_token' parameter, referred to as the "OAuth Callback
   Token".  It is RECOMMENDED that the callback token have a short
   expiration time (i.e., several seconds to a few minutes).

4.3.  Obtaining an Access Token

4.3.1.  Consumer Requests an Access Token

   In addition to the parameters listed in section 6.3.1, the following
   MUST be included as an additional parameter in the request:

   oauth_cb_token  The value received from the Service Provider.

   The signature is computed according to Section 9 of [OAuth].  The
   signature scheme SHOULD be HMAC-SHA1, with the Consumer Secret set to
   the empty string, as described above in Section 4.1.1.

4.3.2.  Service Provider Grants an Access Token

   In addition to performing the verification steps in Section 6.3.2 of
   [OAuth], the Service Provider SHOULD ensure that:

   o  The 'oauth_cb_token' is included and has never been exchanged for
      an access token.

   o  The 'oauth_cb_token' was issued in connection with the
      authorization of the same 'oauth_token' included in the request.

   If all verification tests pass, the Service Provider SHOULD issue the
   'oauth_token' and 'oauth_token_secret' as per [OAuth].

4.4.  Accessing Protected Resources

   The Consumer proceeds as in Section 7 of [OAuth], using an empty
   string as the consumer secret.

5.  Security Considerations

   In order to have better assurance that the request from an
   unregistered consumer is legitimate, the service provider should
   attempt to perform some validation of the callback URL.  In
   particular, if the callback URL contains query parameters it may be
   exploiting an open redirector on a reputable site.  Simply displaying
   the full callback URL to the user is generally not sufficient, as
   most users cannot make informed decisions with this data.  In the
   following, some alternatives are described that will allow service
   providers to acquire greater confidence in the source of the
   requests.

   o  Service providers may limit the format of callback URLs, for
      instance by constraining the form of query parameters that may be
      present.  The 'tame' query parameters may then be safely omitted
      from the UI when requesting authorization.  This reduces the risk
      of confusing users about the origin of requests.  However this
      approach requires unregistered consumers to be made aware of these
      restrictions and perhaps to implement special logic to handle the
      service provider.

   o  If the OAuth request is sent together with an OpenID authorization
      request, as in the OpenID OAuth extension [OpenIDOAuth], and the
      service provider performs callback URL verification via the OpenID
      realm verification mechanism, the provider can be assured with a
      good degree of confidence about the origin of the requests, and
      may use only the shorter OpenID realm URL for UI purposes in
      requesting user authentication.
