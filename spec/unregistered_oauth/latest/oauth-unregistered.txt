1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This extension to the OAuth protocol uses the same terminology for
   Service Providers and Consumers as defined in [OAuth].

3.  Overview

   This extension describes a mechanism for Service Providers to satisfy
   requests from OAuth consumers that have not registered a consumer
   secret, and proposes a strategy to mitigate the security concerns
   that accepting unregistered consumers introduces.

4.  Authenticating with OAuth

4.1.  Obtaining User Authorization

4.1.1.  Consumer Directs the User to the Service Provider

   This differs from Section 6.2.1 of [OAuth] in that 'oauth_callback'
   MUST be included by the Consumer as part of the browser-mediated
   request, and 'oauth_token' MUST NOT be included.  There is also an
   optional parameter 'oauth_callback_method', which signals to the
   Service Provider whether to use GET or POST when redirecting the user
   back to the Consumer:

   oauth_callback  REQUIRED.  The presence of this parameter, and the
      absence of the oauth_token parameter, signals to the Service
      Provider that the Consumer is not registered.  The Service
      Provider will redirect the User back to the Consumer using the URL
      provided in this parameter.

   oauth_callback_method  OPTIONAL.  Values can be "get" or "post".  If
      not specified, the value is assumed to be "post".  This parameter
      specifies whether the Consumer would like the callback URL
      provided in the oauth_callback parameter to be invoked through
      HTTP GET or POST, with POST being the default.

4.1.2.  Service Provider Authenticates the User and Obtains Consent

   The Service Provider MUST use the callback URL to infer the entity
   that the user should trust in the request.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the Service Provider perform verification of
   the callback URL (the precise mechanism for doing so is left
   unspecified here, but see Section 5) some suggestions are provided in
   the security considerations section).

   If callback URL verification is not possible, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the Service Provider indicate to the user that there is a lower level
   of assurance about the identity of the party requesting
   authorization, differentiating these requests from those initiated by
   registered consumers.

   Apart from these considerations, the Service Provider should proceed
   as in Section 6.2.2 of [OAuth].

4.1.3.  Service Provider Directs the User Back to the Consumer

   The Service Provider MUST include an 'oauth_token' parameter.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the OAuth token have a short expiration time (i.e.,

   several seconds to a few minutes).

   The Service Provider SHOULD cause the User's user agent to use the
   HTTP POST method to invoke the callback URL provided in
   Section 4.1.1, unless the Consumer specified
   oauth_callback_method=get in that step.

   When redirecting the User to the Consumer's callback URL through an
   HTTP GET method, the Service Provider SHOULD provide the oauth_token
   parameter in the URL fragment, as opposed to the URL query component.

4.2.  Obtaining an Access Token

4.2.1.  Consumer Requests an Access Token

   The signature is computed according to Section 9 of [OAuth].  The
   signature scheme SHOULD be HMAC-SHA1, with the Consumer Key and
   Consumer Secret, as well as the Request Token Secret set to the empty
   string.

4.2.2.  Service Provider Grants an Access Token

   As usual.

4.3.  Accessing Protected Resources

   The Consumer proceeds as in Section 7 of [OAuth], using an empty
   string as the consumer secret.

5.  Security Considerations

   We RECOMMEND using the HTTP POST method for transmitting the OAuth
   token to the Consumer because most open redirectors don't respond to
   POST requests, and therefore it is less likely that users will be
   tricked into delegating OAuth access to sites they don't intend to.

   If a Consumer is implemented in Javascript and wants to avoid the
   roundtrip to the server, it can specify oauth_callback_method=get in
   Section 4.1.1.  This way, the Service Provider will specify the OAuth
   token in the URL fragment.  This will cause the browser to load the
   corresponding page from its cache in the common case.  It has also
   the benefit of not sending the token to the server if the page has to
   be fetched from the server, as that server might be an open
   redirector.
