1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This extension to the OAuth protocol uses the same terminology for
   Service Providers and Consumers as defined in [OAuth].

3.  Overview

   This extension describes a mechanism for Service Providers to satisfy
   requests from OAuth consumers that have not registered a consumer
   secret, and proposes a strategy to mitigate the security concerns
   that accepting unregistered consumers introduces.

4.  Authenticating with OAuth

4.1.  Obtaining User Authorization

4.1.1.  Consumer Directs the User to the Service Provider

   This differs from Section 6.2.1 of [OAuth] in that 'oauth_callback'
   MUST be included by the Consumer as part of the browser-mediated
   request, and 'oauth_token' MUST NOT be included.

4.1.2.  Service Provider Authenticates the User and Obtains Consent

   The Service Provider MUST use the callback URL to infer the entity
   that the user should trust in the request.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the Service Provider perform verification of
   the callback URL (the precise mechanism for doing so is left
   unspecified here, but see Section 5) some suggestions are provided in
   the security considerations section).

   If callback URL verification is not possible, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the Service Provider indicate to the user that there is a lower level
   of assurance about the identity of the party requesting
   authorization, differentiating these requests from those initiated by
   registered consumers.

   Apart from these considerations, the Service Provider should proceed
   as in Section 6.2.2 of [OAuth].

4.1.3.  Service Provider Directs the User Back to the Consumer

   The service provider MUST include an 'oauth_token' parameter.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the OAuth token have a short expiration time (i.e.,
   several seconds to a few minutes).

4.2.  Obtaining an Access Token

4.2.1.  Consumer Requests an Access Token

   The signature is computed according to Section 9 of [OAuth].  The
   signature scheme SHOULD be HMAC-SHA1, with the Consumer Key and
   Consumer Secret, as well as the Request Token Secret set to the empty
   string.

4.2.2.  Service Provider Grants an Access Token

   As usual.

4.3.  Accessing Protected Resources

   The Consumer proceeds as in Section 7 of [OAuth], using an empty
   string as the consumer secret.

5.  Security Considerations

   In order to have better assurance that the request from an
   unregistered consumer is legitimate, the service provider should
   attempt to perform some validation of the callback URL.  In
   particular, if the callback URL contains query parameters it may be
   exploiting an open redirector on a reputable site.  Simply displaying
   the full callback URL to the user is generally not sufficient, as
   most users cannot make informed decisions with this data.  In the
   following, some alternatives are described that will allow service
   providers to acquire greater confidence in the source of the
   requests.

   o  Service providers SHOULD limit the format of callback URLs, for
      instance by rejecting callback URLs containing query parameters
      without the "oauth" prefix.

   o  Service providers SHOULD also limit the acceptable URI schemes in
      callback URLs, for example by rejecting javascript: URI schemes.
      Many mobile applications register URI schemes as callbacks to
      particular applications; Service Providers may therefore decide to
      blacklist, rather than whitelist, URI schemes.

   o  If the OAuth request is sent together with an OpenID authorization
      request, as in the OpenID OAuth extension [OpenIDOAuth], and the
      service provider performs callback URL verification via the OpenID
      realm verification mechanism, the provider can be assured with a
      good degree of confidence about the origin of the requests, and
      may use only the shorter OpenID realm URL for UI purposes in
      requesting user authentication.
