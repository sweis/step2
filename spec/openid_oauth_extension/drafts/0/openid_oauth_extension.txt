2.  Terminology

   Terms _emphasized_ are pre-defined in either the [OpenID] or the
   [OAuth] specifications.

   Combined Consumer:  A web service that is simultaneously an OpenID
      _Relying Party (RP)_ and an OAuth _Consumer._

   Combined Provider:  A web service that is simultaneously an OpenID
      _Identity Provider (OP)_ and an OAuth _Service Provider (SP)._

3.  Overview

   The OpenID OAuth Extension describes how to make the OpenID
   Authentication and OAuth Core specifications work well together.  In
   its current form, it addresses the use case where the OpenID Provider
   and OAuth Service Provider are the same service.  To provide good
   user experience, it is important to present a combined authentication
   and authorization screen for the two protocols.

   This extension describes how to embed an OAuth approval request into
   an OpenID authentication request to permit combined user approval.
   For security reasons, the OAuth access token is not returned in the
   URL.  Instead a mechanism to obtain the access token is provided.

   The specific mechanisms proposed are extensions to the OpenID
   authentication request and response, and also to the assertion
   verification mechanism, found in Sections 9, 10, and 11 of [OpenID].

4.  Before Requesting Authentication

   The Combined Consumer must, prior to issuing an OpenID authentication
   request, have obtained an unauthorized OAuth request token (Section
   6.1 of [OAuth]).  It must also have performed OpenID discovery and
   (optionally) created an association with the OP as indicated in the
   preamble to Section 9 of [OpenID].

5.  Requesting Authentication

   When Requesting OpenID Authentication via the protocol mode
   "checkid_setup" or "checkid_immediate", this extension can be used to
   request that the end user authorize an OAuth token at the same time
   as their OpenID authorization.  This is done by sending the following
   parameters as part of the OpenID request.

   openid.ns.oauth  REQUIRED.  Value:
      "http://specs.openid.net/extensions/oauth/1.0".

   openid.oauth.req_token  REQUIRED.  Value: The OAuth Unauthorized
      Request token the Consumer wishes the end user to authorize.

                         OpenID OAuth Extension                July 2008


6.  Responding to Authentication Requests

   If the OpenID authentication request cannot be fulfilled (either in
   failure mode "setup_needed" or "cancel" as in Sections 10.2.1 and
   10.2.2 of [OpenID]) then the OAuth request SHOULD be considered to
   fail and the Provider MUST NOT send any OAuth extension values in the
   response.

   The remainder of this section specifies how to handle the OAuth
   request in cases when the OpenID authentication response is a
   positive assertion (Section 10.1 of [OpenID]).

   If the request parameter "openid.oauth.req_token" is present and is a
   valid Unauthorized Request Token, the Combined Provider SHOULD
   determine that an authorized end user wishes to complete the OAuth
   Authorization.

   If the end user does wish to grant access to the Consumer, the
   Combined Provider MUST include and MUST sign the following
   parameters.

   openid.ns.oauth  REQUIRED.  Identical value as defined in Section 5.

   openid.oauth.req_token  REQUIRED.  The value included in the request.

   openid.oauth.cb_token  OPTIONAL.  The callback token MUST be included
      in the response if the Provider supports the 'Unregistered
      Consumer' extension to OAuth, (see [UnregisteredOAuth]), and the
      Consumer is unregistered, as defined in that extension.  Callback
      tokens are needed by an unregistered Combined Consumer to obtain
      an OAuth access token.

   To note that the OAuth Authorization was declined or not valid, the
   Combined Provider SHALL only respond with the parameter
   "openid.ns.oauth".

7.  Requesting the Access Token

   To exchange the request token for an access token, the Combined
   Consumer follows Section 6.3 of [OAuth], or Section x.x of
   [UnregisteredOAuth], whichever is appropriate.  However, if the
   Combined Consumer cannot itself verify the signature in the
   authentication response, it MAY use the following optimization.

7.1.  Optimized Access Token Request for Non-Associated RPs

   If the Combined Consumer cannot itself verify the signature in the
   authentication response, it MUST construct a direct verification
   request, according to section 11.4.2.1 of [OpenID], including all
   openid.* parameters that appeared in the response.  The RP sends the
   OAuth access token request parameters (section 6.3.1 of [OAuth])
   either in the HTTP Authorization header or in the query part of the
   URL (as described in section 5.2 of the same document).  The third
   mechanism defined in the Section 5.2 of [OAuth] cannot be used
   because the OpenID request POST body has an incompatible Mime-type.

8.  Responding to Access Token Requests

   If the OpenID signature verification fails, the Combined Provider
   should not include any OAuth extension parameters in the response,
   and should proceed identically as in Section 11.4.2.2 of [OpenID].

   If the OpenID signature verification succeeds, the Provider verifies
   the OAuth signature, according to Section 9 of [OAuth].

   If the OAuth signature verification fails, the OpenID signature
   verification response proceeds identically as described in Section
   11.4.2.2 of [OpenID].

   If the OAuth signature verification succeeds, the Provider constructs
   an OpenID signature verification response message with the following
   additional parameters:

   openid.ns.oauth  REQUIRED.  Same value as in Section Section 5.

   openid.oauth.access_token  REQUIRED.  The OAuth access token, encoded
      according to Section 5.1 of [OAuth].

   openid.oauth.access_token_secret  REQUIRED.  The OAuth access token
      secret, similarly encoded.

9.  General Considerations

   The proposal takes the approach to insulate each protocol from the
   other, both for backwards compatibility as well as to enable OpenID
   and OAuth to evolve and incorporate additional features without
   requiring reviews of the combined usage described here.  In
   particular:

   OpenID full compatibility  The OpenID identity provider (OP) MAY
      safely announce the endpoint supporting the OAuth extension to all
      relying parties, whether or not they support the extension as
      well.  The use of a separate service-type announcement for
      Combined Providers endpoints provides a mechanism for auto-
      discovery of OAuth capabilities by RPs.

   OAuth token compatibility  The OAuth tokens approved via this
      mechanism MAY be used identically as tokens acquired through
      alternative mechanisms (e.g., via standard OAuth) without
      requiring special considerations either because of functionality
      or security reasons.

10.  Security Considerations

   This proposal composes protocols that provide security services
   (authentication in the case of OpenID, authorization in the case of
   OAuth) with the intention that the combined protocol provides both
   services simultaneously.  Since security is not a property generally
   preserved by composition, the design takes the approach of
   encapsulating the OAuth flow within OpenID in a modular way, and
   applies the general rule-of-thumb of NOT introducing reliance on the
   security properties of one protocol for the correctness of the other.
   Ultimately, only public scrutiny and review can incrementally provide
   confidence that the approach described here is sound from a security
   perspective.

   The following security principles is reflected in this design:

   No long-term OAuth secrets hit the browser  The OAuth protocol was
      designed so that browser-mediated communication is not used to
      transfer long-term secrets or capabilities to access data.
      Instead, temporary approval tokens are exchanged through the
      browser and then exchanged in authenticated server-to-server calls
      for higher-value secrets and tokens.  In this protocol, the use of
      callback_token preserves this feature of the OAuth protocol even
      with unregistered consumers.
